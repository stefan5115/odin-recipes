Hello 
This is my first project on Odin-Project , i hope i will understand this GIT thing.
On this project i will demonstrate my skills with html.
Comeback later to say what i ve done : ) 
Wish me luck!!!

UPDATE : HTML was not a big challenge cuz i already knew it.Suprisely is not a big deal it git and i learn a few commands and how to use it like -> firstly how to create a file with command touch "filename", secondly how to add on github with command git add "filename", thirdly how to commit with command git commit -m "Note" and finally upload the things on github with command git push origin main.
